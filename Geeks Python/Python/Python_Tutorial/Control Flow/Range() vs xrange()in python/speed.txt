Important Points: 

If you want to write code that will run on both Python 2 and Python 3, use range() as the xrange function is deprecated in Python 3.
range() is faster if iterating over the same sequence multiple times.
xrange() has to reconstruct the integer object every time, but range() will have real integer objects. (It will always perform worse in terms of memory however)

range()#	xrange()
Returns a list of integers. #	Returns a generator object.
Execution speed is slower#	Execution speed is faster.
Takes more memory as it keeps the entire list of elements in memory.#	Takes less memory as it keeps only one element at a time in memory.
All arithmetic operations can be performed as it returns a list.#	Such operations cannot be performed on xrange().
In python 3, xrange() is not supported.	#In python 2, xrange() is used to iterate in for loops.
