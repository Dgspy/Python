Some Important Inplace operations :

1. iadd() :- This function is used to assign and add the current value. This operation does “a+=b” operation. Assigning is not performed in case of immutable containers, such as strings, numbers and tuples.

2. iconcat() :- This function is used to concat one string at end of second.

3. isub() :- This function is used to assign and subtract the current value. This operation does “a-=b” operation. Assigning is not performed in case of immutable containers, such as strings, numbers and tuples.

4. imul() :- This function is used to assign and multiply the current value. This operation does “a*=b” operation. Assigning is not performed in case of immutable containers, such as strings, numbers and tuples.

5. itruediv() :- This function is used to assign and divide the current value. This operation does “a/=b” operation. Assigning is not performed in case of immutable containers, such as strings, numbers and tuples.

6. imod() :- This function is used to assign and return remainder . This operation does “a%=b” operation. Assigning is not performed in case of immutable containers, such as strings, numbers and tuples.
